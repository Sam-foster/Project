<h1 align=center>The Spectator</h1>

## About
- I chose to do a site purely like this because i got fed up of most sports bars been hard to navigate around. I simply wanted to design a site that was easy to navigate around and everything was easy to locate like finding what food & drink is available, what sports are showing and if i wanted to book a party/event then i could easy find it.
