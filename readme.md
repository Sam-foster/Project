<h1 align=center>The Spectator</h1>

## About
- I chose to do a site purely like this because i got fed up of most sports bars been hard to navigate around. I simply wanted to design a site that was easy to navigate around and everything was easy to locate like finding what food & drink is available, what sports are showing and if i wanted to book a party/event then i could easy find it.

  ## Testing

  ### Approach 

  I tested the site regularly during the development process, by previewing it in the live server window and inspecting with Google Chrome DevTools at various breakpoints. Simultaneously, I was checking any new additions and changes on several devices available in my household. Any issues found, were addressed at that stage and double checked before moving on with the rest of the project.

Only later in the project, I started using FireFox DevTools found it much easier to play around with styling changes before implementing them into my actual code which could have saved me time and multiple commits for the same element.

In the final stage of the project, I have tested the site thoroughly with automatic validators and manually on different devices and in several browsers, taking into account user stories from the UX section, as per below.


### User stories testing from the UX section

## Deployment

This project was developed using the Gitpod IDE. In order to save and see what I worked with previously I always add commit messenges and then Git push to save and push it to Github.

For deploy this site I had to follow this steps:

* Log in to my account at Github.
* Open the repository that I wanted to deploy.
* Select settings in the menu at the top and scroll down to Pages.
* Open the drop-down menu in the source section.
* Select main instead of none.
* Save and wait a few seconds until it deployed.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my partner, she has been amazing and supportive through all of my first project. I would also like to thank my mentor Marcel Mulders, for pointing me in the right direction. Last but not least my tutor at Harlow college Patrick Justus for our 1 to 1 sessions on a Thursday, these have been really helpful.

The Slack Community has been brilliant, any questions asked they've been really quick to answer them if they can.
